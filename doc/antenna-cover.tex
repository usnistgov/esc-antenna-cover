\title{GAntenna Cover Algorithm}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Given the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item An unlimited supply of sensors, each of which can have multiple antennas,
such that :

\begin{itemize}
\item All antennas have the same aperture angle.
\item A sensor has at least one antenna.
\item A given sensor can have multiple antennas. 
\item Each antenna belonging to a given sensor has the same sensitivity
but each antenna assigned to a sensor may have a different roatation
(azimuth) angle.
\item Different sensors may have antennas having different sensitivities.
\item Sensors can each have different numbers of antennas.
\end{itemize}
\item A set of \textit{possible\_locations} in 2-d space where sensors may
be placed sorted in z-order (also known as Morton order). Call the
lines joining these points in order the \textit{Coastal Line} (CL).
\item An set of \textit{interference\_knot\_points} sorted in z-order. Call
the lines joining these points the \textit{Interference Contour} (IC).
\item CL and IC do not intersect.
\end{itemize}
We call the simple polygon constructed by adding edges from the extremities
of IC to CL, the \textit{Coverage Region} (CR). Our goal is to cover
CR such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The the entire area of CR is covered to within a defined tolerance
(i.e. the tolerance is some small number < 1 denoting the fraction
of the area not covered by any antenna).
\item The region outside CR covered by the antennas is minimized. We call
this the \textit{Excess Region} (ER).
\item The total area of the cover (i.e. the sum of all the areas covered
by each antenna) is minimized.
\item No two sensors are closer to each other than some defined minimum
distance \textit{min\_distance}
\end{itemize}
Determine the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal placement of the sensors 
\item Orientation of the antennas (i.e. azimuth angle with respoect to the
horizontal). 
\item Calibration of the antennas (i.e. \textquotedbl{}optimum\textquotedbl{}
detection range of the antennas at each location where they are placed). 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Algorithm High Level Description}

\textbf{Inputs}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The sorted set of \textit{possible\_centers}
\item The sorted set of \textit{interference\_knot\_points }
\item The \textit{min\_distance} specifying the minimum separation between
two sensors.
\item A family of concetric \textit{detection\_coverage} curves definining
the coverage regions for different antenna sensitivities all oriented
in the same direction. These antenna curves are closed convex curves
centered at \textit{(0,0)} that, in general do not pack into a circle
without overlap. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct the \textit{coverage\_region} (CR):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Constuct a multi-line segment consisting of the points in \textit{possible\_centers}
joined in order.
\item Construct a multi-line segment consisting of the \textit{interference\_knot\_points}
joined in order.
\item Complete the simple polygon to generate CR.
\end{enumerate}
\item Generate a rectangular grid of points such that each point of the
grid is entirely within the region CR. ( We start with some default
grid spacing. This may be adjusted in subsequent steps.) We call the
grid of points thus generated the \textit{interference\_set}.
\item Generate a greedy circle cover (isotropic antenna) for \textit{(possible\_centers,
interference\_set, minum\_separation) }using algorithm \textit{min\_area\_cover\_greedy}.
This returns a set of centers chosen from \textit{possible\_centers}
and a set of radii of circles that cover the\textit{ interference\_set}
such that antennas are spaced apart by at least \textit{min\_distance}
and the set of circles completely covers \textit{interference\_set}
\item Place the antenna lobes (chosen from \textit{detection\_coverage}
) within the circles returned from step 3 such that the antenna lobes
completely cover the intersection area between the circles and CR
using algorithm \textit{find\_antenna\_overlay\_for\_sector}. 
\item Using simulated annealing with a cost function defined as the area
of the convex hull of the cover, rotate the antenna cover lobes on
their assigned sensors so that the cost function is minimized.
\item Eliminate redundant antenna lobes.
\end{enumerate}
We now present the non-obvious steps in greater detail:

\include{algo}

Pictorially, after step 3, we achieve the following circle cover.

The detection\_coverage curves are depicted pictorially as follows:

\includegraphics{/home/mranga/circle-cover/figures/DetectionCoverage_60deg}

After overlaying the detection coverage curves on the circle\_cover
and overlaying, we get the following result. Note that small regions
are uncovered because we eliminate lobes that cover less than threshold
points on our interference\_set :

After applying simulated annealing on the figure above, we get:
